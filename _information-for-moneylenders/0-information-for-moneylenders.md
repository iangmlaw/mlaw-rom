1. How do I start a moneylending business?

To start a moneylending business, you are required to do the following:

i) Register a sole-proprietorship or a partnership, or incorporate a company wherein the principal activity of the business entity is “moneylending”; and

ii) Apply for a moneylender's licence from the Registry of Moneylenders.

You, or the person who will be responsible for the management of the moneylending business, also will be required to pass the moneylender's test on the Moneylenders Act (Cap.188) and Rules conducted by the Registry of Moneylenders. It is advisable that you be familiar with the provisions of the Moneylenders Act (Cap.188) and its Rules, which can be obtained from the following sources:
