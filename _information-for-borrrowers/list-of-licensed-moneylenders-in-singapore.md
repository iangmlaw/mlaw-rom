|Licensed moneylenders are **disallowed** to solicit for loans via text messages or phone calls. If you have received such a message or phone call, it is likely that an unlicensed moneylender has approached you. <br> **Do not respond** to the message or call. <br>

Report possible unlicensed moneylending activities to the Police hotline at 1800-255-000, or submit the information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness. Members of the public may also call the National Crime Prevention Councilâ€™s X-Ah Long hotline at 1800-924-5664.|
